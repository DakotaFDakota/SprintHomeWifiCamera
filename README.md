# SprintHomeWifiCamera

A write up for my journey hacking on a Sprint Home View Security Indoor Wifi Camera (SPRCAM8510A)

The NAND Chip is a MX25L12835F@SOP8.
Still working on identifying the SOC

The project is a work in progress. I have added the firmware file I dumped and the extractd file systems.
