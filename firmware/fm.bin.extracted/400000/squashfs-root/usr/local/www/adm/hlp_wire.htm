   <td>WMM (Wi-Fi Multimedia). It is a standard created to define quality of service (QoS) in Wi-Fi networks. It is a precursor to the IEEE 802.11e WLAN QoS draft standard, which is meant to improve audio, video and voice applications transmitted over Wi-Fi. WMM adds prioritized capabilities to Wi-Fi networks and optimizes their performance when multiple concurring applications, each with different latency and throughput requirements, compete for network resources.</td>

<li>Disabled - No security is used. Anyone using the correct SSID can connect to your network.

<li>WPA/WPA2 Personal - Like WEP, data is encrypted before transmission. WPA is more secure than WEP, and should be used if possible. WPA Personal is the version of WPA which does NOT require a Radius Server on your LAN.
